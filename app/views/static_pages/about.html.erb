<p>Workout Buddy is a web app that helps you record workouts and track your progress. 
There are two main features: workout logging and workout generation. The exercise log page
allows you to log three types of workouts: runs, ab workouts, and weight workouts. The workouts
you log are listed on the page, divided into sections based on the workout time and listed in 
chronological order. The workout generation page generates a workout based on two parameters: 
expected duration and preferred workout type (select one or more of running, abs, and weights). 
The tool will generate a workout that will take approximately as long as the input duration,
and if the user selects abs and/or weights, it suggests a list of exercises.</p>
